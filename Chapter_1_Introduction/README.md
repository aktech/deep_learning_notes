# Chapter 1: Introduction

The First chapter of the book gives a primer on the history of
Artificial Intelligence and the intended Audience of the book.

* In its early days of inception, the field rapidly tackled
and solved problems that are intellectually difficult for
humans but straight forward for computers, i.e. problems that
can be easily described by a set of mathematical rules.

* The true challenge was to solve tasks that are easy for
people to perform intuitively, that feel automatic but hard
for people to describe formally like recognizing spoken words
or faces in images.
